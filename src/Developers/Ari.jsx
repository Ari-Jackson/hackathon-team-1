            Hi! I&apos;m Ari Jackson. I&apos;m a fellow at Pursuit, with experience in web
            development and a passion for leveraging technology to enhance
            efficiency. My journey in web development began with creating systems
            in Notion to boost my personal productivity. The autonomy was
            empowering. I thoroughly enjoyed building more and more databases and
            pages to enable both myself and others to accomplish more. As my
            systems expanded, so did my desire to share them with a wider audience.
            This motivated me to enroll in Pursuit to elevate my web development
            skills and make a greater impact on others.


            Beyond coding, I&apos;m black queer trans man born and raised in Brooklyn.
            I&apos;m an avid learner, particularly when it comes to anything relating to
            nature and history. I cherish spending quality time with my family and
            have a special place in my heart for training my one-too-many dogs.
