            Taylor : Prior to having an interest in code, I worked in early education
            for over 10 years. My passion lies in exploring how technology can bridge
            economic gaps and enhance the accessibility of quality education.

            I did not have any coding experience before I joined Pursuit, however
            this opportunity has challenged me & introduced me to an entirely new
            set of skills and interests. I hope to build more projects both
            independently & collaboratively.

            In my free time I enjoy spending time outdoors with my daughter while
            exploring hobbies such as hiking, kayaking and gardening. I also love
            crafts & I am currently working on floral needlepoint pillow.
