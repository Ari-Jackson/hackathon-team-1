      <p>
            Due to the pandemic, many parents have not had the usual 
            opportunities to confirm that their child is reaching developmental 
            milestones. As a result, schools are seeing unprecedented numbers of 
            children that need support services, but do not have the resources to 
            accommodate these needs. The barriers for parents to seek evaluation 
            services include understanding the complex language of results as well 
            as knowing where to begin seeking support. 
            <br/> <br/>
            Our application seeks to streamline the process & puts the power of 
            evaluation in the parent.s hands.  Then, the parent can search for a 
            quality childcare provider that will assist in supporting their child.s
            needs and beginning the process of providing a possible diagnosis.
