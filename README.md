# Welcome to Tiny Tot Tracker

##  Project Description
Tiny Tots Tracker is a user-friendly app specially designed to empower parents by providing a simple and easy to understand self-evaluation tool for tracking their child's developmental milestones. As every child's journey is unique, Tiny Tots Tracker serves as a preliminary assessment to help parents gain valuable insights into their little one's growth and development. After receiving results, parents can locate a quality child care center in their area to provide support & strengthen developmental progress.

### Features & Benefits :

**User Friendly Interface** - This app was specifically designed with an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface so that parents can clearly administer the evaluation and understand results.

**Personalized, Insightful Results** - Assessment questions are tailored to your childâ€™s age which provides more accurate results. Results can be shared with future childcare providers or medical professionals to achieve formal diagnosis for concerns.

**Resources and Guidance** - Tiny Tots Tracker acknowledges that self-evaluation is not a substitute for professional assessments. As such, the app will offer curated resources and guidance, connecting parents with trusted experts for a comprehensive confirmation process.
